# React Native AsyncStorage: AsyncStorage not ready error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when using AsyncStorage: attempting to access AsyncStorage before it's fully initialized.  This often occurs within `componentDidMount`.  The solution involves ensuring AsyncStorage is ready before any access attempts.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs because AsyncStorage requires time to initialize.  Attempting to access it prematurely may lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes.  The error may not always be explicitly caught, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves utilizing `AsyncStorage.getItem` (or other methods) only after AsyncStorage is ready. This is typically done after the app's initial load and layout has completed, ensuring AsyncStorage is fully operational.
