This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native.  The problem arises when you try to access AsyncStorage before it's fully initialized.  This can happen if you attempt to read or write data within a component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method before the AsyncStorage is ready.

```javascript
//Buggy Code
componentDidMount() {
  AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then((value) => {
    // Use the value
  });
}
```
